Overview of the sklearn modules we will be using
1) stream instances
2) Feature Extraction
- statefull vs stateless victorizor
- hashing trick
3) increment algorithm
- Although all algorithms cannot learn incrementally (i.e. without seeing all the instances at once), all estimators implementing the partial_fit API are candidates.
- learning from every mini-batch gurantees that at any given time there will be a small amount of instances (examples) in the main memory
- key point: choosing the size of the minibatch that gives relevant info without compensating too much of the memory
- choose the estimator algorithm!!
